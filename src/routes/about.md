# About Lenny Ochanda

Hello, I am a Front End Developer with knowledge of the Back End. I occassionaly write about some topics that arise as I go through my journey as a software developer.

My journey into web development began in 2019 when a friend casually introduced me to HTML and the W3C website. I went on to learn HTML and CSS, briefly learnt C, studied and practised Python until very early in 2021 when I decided that I wanted to be a full stack developer, to compliment my Bachelor of Commerce (Finance Option). I have since completed the Foundations part of The Odin Project which covered _HTML, CSS and JS_ and recently started building projects, some of which you may find in the <a href="/projects">Projects page</a>. 

I am currently working on the _Deep Dive into Modern Web Development_ online course offered by The University of Helsinki. It is a hands on course where I learn by building stuff. I have so far covered:

<ul>
  <li>Fundamentals of Web apps,</li>
  <li>Introduction to React, </li>
  <li>Communicating with the server and</li>
  <li>Programming a server with NodeJS and Express.</li>
</ul>

The rest of the course covers Testing, State Management with Redux, Webpack, custom hooks, GraphQL, TypeScript, React Native, CI/CD, Containers and Relational Databases.
        
I would love an opportunity to collaborate in _ReactJS (NextJS), SveltJS (SvelteKit), MERN_ projects and the JavaScript eco-system which I find to be very broad && diverse. I will write about the above topics among other things as a means to hold myself accountable and also helping those who haven't found the answers they need through alternative means. 

Let's connect on [Social Media](/contact). Cheers.
