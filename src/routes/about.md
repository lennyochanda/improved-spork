# About Lenny

Hello, I am a `Front End Developer` with some knowledge of the Back End. I occassionaly write about some topics that arise as I go through my journey as a software developer.

My journey into web development began in 2020 when a friend introduced me to HTML and the W3C website. I went on to learn HTML and CSS, learnt C and practised with Python until February 2021 when I decided that I wanted to be a full stack web developer, concurrently while obtaining my Bachelor's Degree in Commerce(Finance Option). I have since completed the Foundations part of The Odin Project which covered _HTML, CSS and JS_ and recently started building projects, some of which you may find in the [`Projects page`](/projects). 

I am currently working on the _Deep Dive into Modern Web Development_ online course offered by The University of Helsinki. It is a hands on course where I learn by building stuff. I have so far covered:

<ul>
  <li>Fundamentals of Web apps</li>
  <li>Introduction to React</li>
  <li>Communicating with the server and</li>
  <li>Programming a server with NodeJS and Express.</li>
</ul>

The rest of the course covers Testing, State Management with Redux, Webpack, custom hooks, GraphQL, TypeScript, React Native, CI/CD, Containers and Relational Databases.
        
I would love an opportunity to collaborate in _ReactJS (NextJS), SveltJS (SvelteKit), MERN_ projects and the `JavaScript` eco-system which I find to be very broad && diverse. I will write about the above topics among others so stay tuned! 

Let's connect on [`Social Media`](/contact). Cheers.
